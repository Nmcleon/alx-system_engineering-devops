0x01. Shell, permissions

These are commonly used Linux/Unix shell commands related to permissions and user management:

1. `chmod` - Stands for "change mode." It is used to change file permissions, allowing you to specify who can read, write, or execute a file.

2. `sudo` - Short for "superuser do," it is used to execute commands with superuser or administrative privileges. It allows authorized users to perform administrative tasks.

3. `su` - Stands for "switch user" or "substitute user." It is used to switch to another user account, including the root user, by entering their password.

4. `chown` - Stands for "change owner." It is used to change the ownership of a file or directory. You can change both the owner and group of the file.

5. `chgrp` - Stands for "change group." It is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

6. `id` - Displays the user and group IDs, as well as the groups a user belongs to. It's helpful for checking user and group information.

7. `groups` - Lists the groups to which the current user belongs. It provides a list of group memberships for the user.

8. `whoami` - Prints the username of the current user. It's a quick way to determine your own username.

9. `adduser` - A user-friendly command for adding new users to the system. It creates user accounts, sets passwords, and more.

10. `useradd` - A lower-level command for adding users. It's used for creating user accounts with specific options but may require more manual configuration.

11. `addgroup` - Similar to `adduser`, it's used to add a new group to the system.

In summary, these commands are essential for managing file permissions, user accounts, and group memberships in a Linux/Unix shell environment. They help in controlling who can access, modify, or execute files and directories on the system, and also in managing user accounts and groups.

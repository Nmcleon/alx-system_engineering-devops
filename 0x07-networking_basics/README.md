# Networking Basics

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts and educational materials related to networking basics. Each script is designed to help you understand and work with fundamental networking concepts. Below is an overview of the scripts and their respective topics.

## 0. OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract framework that describes the layered communication and design of computer networks. It divides network communication into seven layers, from the physical transmission layer to the application-specific layer. This script provides an introduction to the OSI model and its organization.

**Questions:**

- What is the OSI model?
- How is the OSI model organized?

## 1. Types of Network

This script explains different types of networks, including LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet. It helps you understand how various networks are interconnected and their purposes.

**Questions:**

- What type of network is a computer connected to locally?
- What type of network connects offices in different buildings a few streets away?
- What network is used when browsing a website from a smartphone not connected to Wi-Fi?

## 2. MAC and IP Address

Learn about MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. Understand the roles of these addresses in network communication.

**Questions:**

- What is a MAC address?
- What is an IP address?

## 3. UDP and TCP

This script explains the differences between UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), two common transport layer protocols in networking. It helps you understand their characteristics and use cases.

**Questions:**

- Characteristics of TCP and UDP protocols.

## 4. TCP and UDP Ports

Discover the importance of ports in networking, specifically for TCP and UDP protocols. Learn about well-known port numbers and how to display listening ports with a Bash script.

**Example:**

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
# Displays listening ports with PID and program names
```

## 5. Is the Host on the Network

Understand the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and how it's used to check the availability of network devices. Use a Bash script to ping an IP address and display the results.

**Example:**

```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
# Ping an IP address and display the results
```

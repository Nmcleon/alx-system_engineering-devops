**Issue Summary:**

*Duration:* 
The Apache 500 Internal Server Error issue occurred and was resolved within a timeframe of 45 minutes.

*Impact:* 
Users accessing the server were experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error while making requests to Apache.

*Root Cause:* 
The root cause of the issue was identified using `strace` and traced to a misconfiguration in the `wp-settings.php` file, specifically an erroneous occurrence of "phpp" instead of "php".

---

**Timeline:**

*Detection Time:*
- The issue was initially detected when a request to Apache returned a 500 Internal Server Error.

*Detection Method:*
- `strace` was used to trace the issue. A tmux session was set up with `strace` running in one window and `curl` in another.

*Actions Taken:*
- Investigated the Apache error logs to identify the cause.
- Used `strace` to trace system calls and identify the root cause.
  
*Misleading Paths:*
- There were no misleading paths in this case. The use of `strace` efficiently led to the identification of the issue.

*Escalation:*
- The incident was not escalated as it was resolved at the system administration level.

*Resolution:*
- The issue was resolved by creating a Puppet manifest (`0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`) to automate the correction of the misconfiguration in the `wp-settings.php` file.

---

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

*Root Cause Explanation:*
- The root cause was traced to an incorrect occurrence of "phpp" in the `wp-settings.php` file, leading to a syntax error.

*Resolution Details:*
- Puppet was used to automate the correction by replacing "phpp" with "php" in the specified file (`/var/www/html/wp-settings.php`).

---

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

*Improvements/Fixes:*
- Ensure regular checks for misconfigurations in critical files, especially after updates or changes.

*Tasks to Address the Issue:*
1. Implement automated checks for critical file integrity.
2. Periodic review of Apache error logs for early detection of anomalies.
3. Implement a Puppet manifest to correct common misconfigurations.

---

In conclusion, the Apache 500 Internal Server Error issue was successfully resolved by identifying and correcting a misconfiguration in the `wp-settings.php` file. The use of `strace` and Puppet automation ensured a swift and effective resolution. To prevent similar issues in the future, measures have been outlined to enhance proactive monitoring and automate the correction of common misconfigurations.

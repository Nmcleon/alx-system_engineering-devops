### 1. Create a SSH RSA key pair
Generate an SSH RSA key pair and share the public key in the `0-RSA_public_key.pub` file. The private key should be kept securely.

### 2. For Best School loop
A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a `for` loop.

### 3. While Best School loop
A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a `while` loop.

### 4. Until Best School loop
A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an `until` loop.

### 5. If 9, say Hi!
A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays "Hi" on a new line.

### 6. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
A Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and displays "bad luck" for the 4th loop iteration, "good luck" for the 8th loop iteration, and "Best School" for the other iterations.

### 7. Superstitious numbers
A Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and displays specific messages for the 4th, 9th, and 17th loop iterations using a `case` statement.

### 8. Clock
A Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a `while` loop.

### 9. For ls
A Bash script that lists the content of the current directory in a specific format, displaying only the part of the name after the first dash using a `for` loop.

### 10. To file, or not to file
A Bash script that provides information about a file named "school." It checks if the file exists, if it's empty or not, and if it's a regular file.

### 11. FizzBuzz
A Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100 and follows the FizzBuzz rules to display specific messages for multiples of 3 and 5.

### 12. Read and cut
A Bash script that displays specific information about users from the `/etc/passwd` file using `read` and `cut` commands.

### 13. Tell the story of passwd
A Bash script that displays a story about users based on the content of the `/etc/passwd` file using `IFS` and `awk`.

### 14. Let's parse Apache logs
A Bash script that parses an Apache log file to display visitor IP addresses along with HTTP status codes using `awk`.

### 15. Dig the data
A Bash script that groups visitor IPs and HTTP status codes from the Apache log file, displaying the data with occurrence numbers in descending order using `awk`.

These scripts cover various aspects of Bash scripting and are designed to help in learning and practicing Bash scripting skills.
